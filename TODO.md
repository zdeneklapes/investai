# AI-INVESTING: Bachelor Thesis

## TODO

- [ ] Update forked finrl-meta to latest version
- [ ] Clean up the code
- [ ] Add more comments
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Add more examples

-------------------- -------------------- --------------------

### IDEAS

- Build (Neural network | ...)
- which will (train NN | ...)
- that can predict the (next move | long prediction | ...)
- based on the (change of any fundamental data | sentiment).
- RL train multiple agents
- Binary classifier that subject to trade will go up/down (SVM)
- Finite/infinite automatically building state machine consists in probabilities
- Find correlation between some features (indicators | ...) and result Â±1-5% (Gaussian Distribution)

#### DIVERSIFICATION

- Using:
  - Investing into different sectors

#### RL: Features

- Which companies have the most amount of cash available relative to amount of debt?
- Which companies have the biggest profit relative to amount of debt?
- Which companies have the biggest sales margin?
- Which companies have the biggest sales margin?
- Which companies are increasing profits constantly
- Which companies are decreasing debts constantly?
- Which companies are increasing dividend yield?
- Which companies are the oldest?
- Which companies are the youngest?

##### HINTS

- The company exist a long time so the growth can be slower than in the young company
- Result: (make the union on the top most companies | train NN | ...)
- combination of financial series classification and portfolio optimization surpasses each of the single approaches
