# IDEAS / TODO

- Start project

## IDEAS (MAIN)

- Build (Neural network | ...)
- which will (train NN | ...)
- that can predict the (next move | long prediction | ...)
- based on the (change of any fundamental data | sentiment).
- RL train multiple agents
- Binary classifier that subject to trade will go up/down (SVM)
- Finite/infinite automatically building state machine consists in probabilities
- Find correlation between some features (indicators | ...) and result Â±1-5% (Gaussian Distribution)

## STOCK'S DIVISION

- By:
-
    - sector

## FEATURES_1: SORT BY

- Which companies have the most amount of cash available relative to amount of debt?
- Which companies have the most biggest profit relative to amount of debt?
- Which companies have the biggest sales margin?
- Which companies have the biggest sales margin?
- Which companies are increasing profits constantly
- Which companies are decreasing debts constantly?
- Which companies are increasing dividend yield?
- Which companies are the oldest?
- Which companies are the youngest?

> Result: (make the union on the top most companies | train NN | ...)

## FEATURES_2

- The company exist a long time so the growth can be slower than in the young company

## ALREADY TESTED

- combination of financial series classification and portfolio optimization surpasses each of the single approaches

## RL
- HJB Equation
